## Usage

> [!Note]
> The app needs accessibility to get all windows and focus windows in the active space, and
> needs screen recording to get the window previews.

1. Use hotkey (option + tab) to open the window switcher.
2. Type to search for a window, or use arrow keys to move your selection.
3. Press `enter` to switch to the selected window.

## Installation

### Homebrew

This app is also available as a cask on Homebrew.

```sh
brew install --cask sean01zhang/formulae/window-switcher
```

### Manually

## Upgrading

> Due to packaging limitations, you must **remove** any previously granted Accessibility and Screen Recording permissions **before** launching the updated app, and then **re-grant** them after the new version starts.
